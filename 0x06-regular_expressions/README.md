# RegexDevOps - Regular Expression Project

## Overview

Welcome to the RegexDevOps project! This project focuses on mastering regular expressions using Oniguruma, the default regular expression library for Ruby. Follow the instructions and complete the tasks to enhance your regex skills.

## Concepts

- Regular Expression

## Background Context

In this project, you'll be using Oniguruma, the regular expression library used by Ruby by default. Ensure that your regular expressions are tailored for Oniguruma, as other libraries may have different properties.

Here's a sample Ruby code template:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts ARGV[0].scan(/your_regular_expression/).join
```

## Resources

Before diving in, familiarize yourself with the basics and advanced concepts of regular expressions. Rubular will be your best friend for testing. Remember, using a regular expression might introduce new challenges, so be prepared!

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Files end with a new line
- README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder
- All Bash script files must be executable
- First line of all Bash scripts: `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`
- All regex must be built for the Oniguruma library

## Tasks

### Task 0: Simply Matching School

- The regex must match "School"
- Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method

Example:

```bash
$ ./0-simply_match_school.rb School | cat -e
School$
$ ./0-simply_match_school.rb "Best School" | cat -e
School$
$ ./0-simply_match_school.rb "School Best School" | cat -e
SchoolSchool$
$ ./0-simply_match_school.rb "Grace Hopper" | cat -e
$
```

4155049898$
$ ./6-phone_number.rb " 4155049898" | cat -e
$
$ ./6-phone_number.rb "415 504 9898" | cat -e
$
$ ./6-phone_number.rb "415-504-9898" | cat -e
$
```
