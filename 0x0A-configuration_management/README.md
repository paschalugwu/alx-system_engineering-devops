![Puppet Logo](https://puppet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/PRDS-Featured-Image-Puppet.jpg)

This repository contains a set of Puppet manifests for the Configuration Management project in the ALX Software Engineering curriculum. The project is developed by Sylvain Kalache and focuses on DevOps, Systems Administration, Scripting, and CI/CD practices.

## Background Context

During his time at SlideShare, Sylvain Kalache worked on an auto-remediation tool named Skynet. This tool monitored, scaled, and fixed Cloud infrastructure using a parallel job-execution system called MCollective. However, a bug in his code caused unexpected server shutdowns, highlighting the importance of proper configuration management tools like Puppet.

Using Puppet, installs Flask from pip3 with a specific version.

- Package: `flask`
- Version: `2.1.0`

Example usage:
```bash
puppet apply 1-install_a_package.pp
```

Example usage:
```bash
puppet apply 2-execute_a_command.pp
```
