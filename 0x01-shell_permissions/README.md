At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
Permissions

1.    What do the commands chmod, sudo, su, chown, chgrp do
2.    Linux file permissions
3.    How to represent each of the three sets of permissions (owner, group, and other) as a single digit
4.    How to change permissions, owner and group of a file
5.    Why canâ€™t a normal user chown a file
6.    How to run a command with root privileges
7.    How to change user ID or become superuser
