# Project: 0x0D. Web stack debugging #0

## Overview
This project is part of the curriculum for SE Foundations Average and focuses on Web stack debugging. It is intended to train students in the art of debugging, an essential skill for DevOps, SysAdmin, Scripting, and Debugging roles.

### Concepts Covered
For this project, students are expected to understand the following concepts:
- Network basics
- Docker
- Web stack debugging

### Background Context
The Webstack debugging series is designed to train students in debugging. It emphasizes the importance of debugging skills for Full-Stack Software Engineers and provides hands-on experience in diagnosing and fixing broken or bugged webstacks.

### Task Details
The first task in this project requires students to debug a web server issue and ensure that Apache returns a page containing "Hello Holberton" when queried at the root. A broken Docker container is provided, and students must identify and fix the issue manually before creating a Bash script to automate the process.

### Installing Docker
Students are provided with instructions on installing Docker on their local machines or VMs to experiment with and solve the task locally. Supported platforms include Mac OS, Windows, Ubuntu 14.04, and Ubuntu 16.04.

### Resources
Students are encouraged to refer to the `curl` command's manual or help pages for assistance during the project.

### Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- All Bash script files must be executable
- Scripts must pass Shellcheck without errors
- Scripts must run without errors
- First line of scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- Second line of scripts should be a comment explaining the script's purpose

## Task
### 0. Give me a page! (mandatory)
Students are tasked with debugging an Apache web server issue in a Docker container. They must ensure that the server returns a page containing "Hello Holberton" when queried at the root. A sample Docker command and expected output are provided for reference.

### Repository Information
- GitHub repository: [alx-system_engineering-devops](https://github.com/alx-system_engineering-devops)
- Directory: `0x0D-web_stack_debugging_0`
- File: `0-give_me_a_page`

## Conclusion
This project provides students with practical experience in web stack debugging, a critical skill for software engineering roles. By successfully completing the tasks, students will improve their ability to diagnose and fix issues in web server environments, contributing to their overall proficiency in DevOps, SysAdmin, Scripting, and Debugging.
