# Web Stack Debugging #3

## Overview

This project focuses on debugging a Wordpress website running on a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack. Participants will utilize strace to diagnose and resolve a 500 Internal Server Error returned by Apache. Additionally, the fix will be automated using Puppet instead of Bash.

## Background Context

Debugging web applications often requires going beyond traditional log analysis. Wordpress, powering a significant portion of the web, runs on the LAMP stack. Understanding how to troubleshoot issues within this environment is essential for DevOps and SysAdmin roles.

## Requirements

### General

- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- **File Format:** All files should end with a new line
- **Documentation:** A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- **Puppet Manifests:**
  - Must pass puppet-lint version 2.1.1 without errors
  - Must run without error
  - Must begin with a comment explaining the Puppet manifest's purpose
  - Files must have the .pp extension
  - Will be checked with Puppet v3.4

### More Info

```
$ apt-get install -y ruby
$ gem install puppet-lint -v 2.1.1

## Tasks
