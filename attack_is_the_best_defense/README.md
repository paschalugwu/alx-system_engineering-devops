# Attack is the Best Defense

## Project Overview

This project, developed by Sylvain Kalache, is an optional assignment designed to delve into advanced concepts related to network security, scripting, and hacking. Participants will explore topics such as ARP spoofing, network sniffing, dictionary attacks, and more.

## Concepts Covered

In this project, participants are expected to gain knowledge and understanding of the following concepts:

- Network basics
- Docker

## Background Context

This project is entirely optional and carries a significant bonus. Completing any part of this project will result in a project grade of over 100% added to your average. However, failure to complete it will not affect your current average negatively. Keep in mind that if your current average exceeds your score on this project, your average might decrease. Enjoy exploring and learning!

## Resources

### Read/Watch:

- Network sniffing
- ARP spoofing
- Connecting to SendGrid’s SMTP relay using telnet
- Understanding Docker and its popularity
- Dictionary attack

### Man/Help:

- `tcpdump`
- `hydra`
- `telnet`
- `docker`

## Tasks

### 0. ARP Spoofing and Sniffing Unencrypted Traffic

**Difficulty:** Advanced

This task focuses on network security and involves sniffing unencrypted network traffic to extract information. Participants will simulate telnet authentication and use `tcpdump` to sniff network traffic to find a password.

### 1. Dictionary Attack

**Difficulty:** Advanced

Participants will explore the vulnerability of password-based authentication systems to dictionary attacks. The task involves installing Docker, pulling and running a Docker image, finding a password dictionary, and using `hydra` to attempt brute-force authentication via SSH.
