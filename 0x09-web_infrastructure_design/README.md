# Web Infrastructure Design Project

## Overview
This project involves designing and implementing various web infrastructure setups. The tasks cover concepts such as DNS, monitoring, web servers, network basics, load balancers, and servers. The goal is to build a scalable, secure, and monitored web infrastructure.

### Concepts
- DNS
- Monitoring
- Web Server
- Network basics
- Load Balancer
- Server

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Draw a diagram covering the web stack built in sysadmin/devops track projects.
- Explain the role of each component in the infrastructure.
- Understand system redundancy.
- Be familiar with acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS.

## Requirements

### General
- **README.md**: A mandatory file at the root of the project folder.
- **Whiteboarding**: Diagrams for each task on a whiteboard, with a picture/screenshot provided.
- **Manual QA Review**: Requested upon project completion.

### Tasks

#### 0. Simple web stack
- Design a one-server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com.
- Components: 1 server, 1 web server (Nginx), 1 application server, 1 application files, 1 database (MySQL).
- Specifics: Role of each component, DNS record types, issues with the infrastructure.
