# Project Title: Networking Basics #0

## Description

This project, developed by Sylvain Kalache, is part of the ALX DevOps program. The focus is on understanding fundamental networking concepts, including the OSI model, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, TCP and UDP protocols, and the usage of ports. The project also introduces practical tasks like displaying listening ports and creating a script to ping an IP address.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, participants are expected to:

- Explain the OSI Model, including its layers and organization.
- Understand LAN (Local Area Network) and WAN (Wide Area Network) concepts.
- Define the Internet and grasp the basics of IP addresses, subnetting, and the need for IPv6.
- Differentiate between TCP and UDP protocols, knowing their main characteristics and use cases.
- Memorize important port numbers, such as those for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
- Develop scripts for practical networking tasks using Bash scripting.
- Enhance troubleshooting skills by displaying listening ports and performing ICMP ping tests.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into tasks, each addressing specific networking concepts and practical applications. The tasks are as follows:

1. **0-OSI_model**
   - Introduces the OSI model and its organization.
   - Provides multiple-choice questions to test understanding.

2. **1-types_of_network**
   - Explores the types of networks, including LAN, WAN, and the Internet.
   - Tests knowledge through multiple-choice questions.

3. **2-MAC_and_IP_address**
   - Discusses MAC addresses as unique identifiers for network interfaces.
   - Explores the purpose and role of IP addresses.

4. **3-UDP_and_TCP**
   - Fills in the blanks related to the TCP and UDP boxes in a diagram.
   - Tests understanding of the characteristics of TCP and UDP.

5. **4-TCP_and_UDP_ports**
   - Develops a Bash script to display listening ports.
   - Demonstrates knowledge of commonly used ports and their associations.

6. **5-is_the_host_on_the_network**
   - Requires the creation of a Bash script to perform ICMP ping tests on a given IP address.
   - Emphasizes the use of the ping command for network troubleshooting.

## Requirements

- Scripts must be developed using editors like vi, vim, or emacs.
- All Bash script files should be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- The README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- Scripts must be executable and pass shellcheck without errors.
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
- The second line of each script should be a comment explaining its purpose.
- Participants are encouraged to complete the tasks themselves without resorting to plagiarism.

## Usage

To run each script, follow the instructions provided in the README.md file for each corresponding task.

## Additional Resources

- Information about the OSI model, LAN, WAN, Internet, MAC addresses, IP addresses, TCP, UDP, and related topics.
- Manual pages for commands like `netstat` and `ping`.

## Copyright and Plagiarism

- Participants are reminded of the importance of original work and understanding the concepts for learning objectives.
- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and may result in removal from the program.
