# The Great Coffee Spill Incident of 2024

## Issue Summary
On April 9, 2024, from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM (GMT+1), our main web service experienced an outage. The impact was significant - the service was down, users were seeing 404 errors, and approximately 75% of our users were affected. The root cause? A rogue coffee spill on our primary server (yes, you read that right).

## Timeline
- **9:30 AM**: The issue was detected when our monitoring system alerted us to a sudden drop in server responses.
- **9:35 AM**: Initial assumption was a code bug or a DDoS attack. Teams started investigating these areas.
- **9:45 AM**: After finding no issues in the code or traffic, the team started investigating hardware issues.
- **10:00 AM**: The incident was escalated to the senior DevOps team.
- **10:30 AM**: The team discovered a coffee spill on the server. The server was immediately shut down for cleaning and drying.
- **11:00 AM**: The server was back online and the incident was resolved.

## Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the issue was a coffee spill on the primary server. The liquid caused a short circuit, leading to the server failure. The issue was fixed by cleaning and drying the server, and then restarting it.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
While the coffee spill gave us a good laugh, it also highlighted areas for improvement:
- **Physical security of servers**: Our servers need to be in a secure location where accidents like this can't occur.
- **Backup systems**: We need robust backup systems that can seamlessly take over if the primary server fails.

Here's our TODO list:
- Move the server to a secure, no-food-allowed location.
- Set up a secondary server as a backup.
- Implement monitoring on the backup server.

And remember, folks, no drinks near the servers!
